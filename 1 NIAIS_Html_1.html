        <h1> Heading 1</h1>

        <p> Here is the first paragraph. It will show the text as per built-in structure. Here i am giving            
        multiple spaces but it will not be shown.
        </p>



        <pre>
        <div id="one">
        In "p " tag we can not bring changes as per our desire such as giving a lot of spaces but here in "pre" 
        tag we can. E.g  
                                                                        woooooo.
        Here, i also have used div which is used for partition, and to apply any function it is 
        called in a style tag.

        Within the tag of div, id is also defined to distinguish particular div.

        </div></pre>

        <h2 style= "color: blue; font-size: 50px;"> Intro to CSS</h2>


        <P style="font-size: large;"> CSS stand for cascading style sheet. Its is smiliar to the paint over house while html is 
        like grey-structure of house.</P>


        <pre style="font-size: large;"> <div id="two">
         There are three type of css: 
        -Inline: It is only used in opening tag such as with h1/h2. In second heading color is changed 
         by putting an attribue "style" and property "blue" in the following way:
          style= "color: blue;"
          We also have changed the font size of second paragrapgh and also of this very paragragh by using
          style="font-size: large;

        -Internal: in internal css, everything is defined within head-tag and also inside of style-tag. Moreover, 
        unique id ust be given to every div-tag.
        

        -External
        </div>
        </pre>
